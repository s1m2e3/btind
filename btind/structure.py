"""Structure moves: add an arm, drop an arm, re-order the Fallback.

`qwire` can move a threshold; it cannot change how many arms there are or which
one sees a state first. Both of those are decisions the pipeline currently makes
by accident -- `rsfi` buys arms greedily and never revisits one, so the arm count
is whatever the acceptance test happened to allow and the PRIORITY is the order
in which arms were bought. In a Fallback the order is semantics, not layout.

Three operators, one acceptance rule, and one asymmetry that matters:

  ADD       a proposed clause is inserted directly ABOVE the arm it specialises,
            because that is the only position where it claims the rows the
            proposal was scored on.
  DROP      accepted on NON-INFERIORITY, not improvement: the paired test has to
            fail to show a loss. Everywhere else the burden of proof is on the
            change, here it is on the arm -- an arm that cannot demonstrate it is
            earning its place is a literal a reader has to hold for nothing.
  REORDER   adjacent swaps only, and only where the two clauses actually overlap;
            a swap of disjoint clauses is a no-op that would still consume a
            rollout and, at z = 2, occasionally be "accepted" by noise.
